# personal-website
The backend files for my personal website.

Generated using [JSON Resume](http://jsonresume.org/), a useful standardized resume format supported by a library of themes.

The custom JSON Resume theme I made for this website is located [here](https://github.com/MckennaCisler/jsonresume-theme-concise).
